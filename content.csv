https://www.tatacapital.com/blog/personal-use-loan/800-plus-credit-score-how-to-make-the-most-of-it/,"800-Plus Credit Score: How to Make the Most of It. By Tata Capital. 05 April 2024. 6 mins read. 2063. Lenders extend loans and lines of credit depending on a borrower’s creditworthiness. They use credit scores to judge whether borrowers can repay the loan. Higher the score, the better the experience you will have when availing loan. 800 score or more means you are exceptional at managing your credit and getting faster loan approvals and benefits. In this blog, we will understand the significance of having a credit score of 800, benefits of the credit rating, and how you can boost your score. So, let us dive in. Basics of credit score. Before we check your credit score and the benefits of credit rating, let us first understand what a credit score is. Credit scores are three-digit numbers in the 300 to 850 range. Lenders use this score to assess a borrower’s creditworthiness. Lenders calculate credit scores using borrowers’ credit reports or credit history. Here are five key factors, along with the percentage of the score they make up for:. Payment history (35%) shows whether you have paid your bills on time. Accounts owed (30%) are the credit and loans you are using. Credit history’s length (15%) shows how long you have been using credit. Credit mix (10%) is the types of credit (home loan, vehicle loan, credit cards) you have availed. New credit inquiries (10%) show the frequency of your credit inquiries. How to Increase Your Credit Score to 800-Plus. 1. Prioritize On-Time Payments: Promptly paying bills and credit card balances improves credit score. Use auto-pay facilities to avoid missing payments. 2. Manage Credit Utilization Ratio: Keep your credit utilization ratio below 30%. 3. Build a Lengthy Credit History: Apply for credit responsibly and maintain active accounts over an extended period. Advantages of credit rating of 800 and more. Broadly, the benefits of a credit rating of 800-plus open many opportunities to avail affordable credit and other financial benefits. Let us understand in detail some key advantages of a credit rating of 800-plus:. 1. Better chance at loan approval. A credit score is the representation of your creditworthiness. Higher the score, the better the chances of loan approval, and vice versa. And a credit score of 800 means you are an extremely reliable borrower who is more than likely to repay the debt. As a result, lenders are more likely to extend your loans or line of credit. 2. Higher loan amounts and lower interest rates. Lenders may lend you money even with a 600-700 credit score, but you may not get a higher loan amount and pay more in interest. But one of the biggest 800 credit score benefits is that you get your loan approved and the amount you want at lower interest rates. Even with a credit card, an 800 score opens you to a higher credit limit with lower interest rates. 3. Refinance your loans. Apart from helping you save money in interest payments, 800 plus credit score can help you refinance your existing loans. For example, if you took a loan when your credit score was low, work towards improving it. Once you reach a score of 800 or more, you can refinance your loans to lower interest rates. 4. Better offers and rewards. As you know, credit card companies offer rewards like redeemable points, cashback, discounts on fuel, etc. With a credit score of 800, you can easily qualify for a credit card with the best possible rewards. 5. Renting a house. Apart from access to better home loan, vehicle loan, and credit cards, an 800 score also helps you easily rent a house. Landlords may check your credit score to assess your payment history, and with a high credit score, you will seem to be a reliable tenant. Check your credit score. Now you know the advantages of a credit rating with an 800 plus score, but how do you see your score? Let us explore some ways to calculate credit scores in this section. In India, most lenders use credit scores from two credit reporting organizations – Experian and CIBIL. Both organizations use their proprietary algorithms to calculate credit scores. But both CIBIL and Experian provide scores in the 300 to 850 range. And scores above 700 are good, and above 800 are considered exceptional. Check CIBIL score. To check your CIBIL score, you will need identity proof and some basic details. Follow these steps to check your CIBIL credit score:. Head to the CIBIL website and click “Get Your CIBIL Score.”. Complete the form and click “Accept & Continue.”. You will receive OTP on your phone number. Enter that OTP and click “Continue.”. Now, select “Dashboard” and click on “Member Login.” Enter your credentials, and you will get your CIBIL credit score. 2. Check Experian credit score. Using Tata Capital’s online credit score checking facility, you can check your Experian credit score. Just follow these steps:. Head to Tata Capital’s credit check page and click on “New Customer.”. Complete the form and click “Submit.”. You will receive an OTP on your phone number for verification. And that’s it, there is your Experian credit score. Note: Existing customers of Tata Capital must select “Existing Customer” on the credit check page. They will receive an OTP when entered will reveal their Experian credit score. Boost your score to get the advantages of a credit rating. The benefits of a credit rating of 800, like fast loan approval, higher credit limit, and lower interest rates, enable you to meet your financial obligations and attain financial stability. So, if you fall short of an 800-credit score, the benefits are too good not to try to improve your score. Here is how you can boost your score and take full advantage of your credit rating:. Paying bills on time is the best way to boost your credit score. Automate recurring payments and bills using autopay facilities to avoid missing any payments. Lower your credit utilization by using not more than 30% of the available credit limit. To boost your credit score, you need a credit history. So, try and take a mix of secured and unsecured loans and repay them on time to build a positive credit history. Bottom line. The advantages of a credit rating of 800, like easy loan approval, higher credit limit and lower interest, come in handy when you need immediate funds or face an emergency. To avail of these benefits, ensure to pay bills on time, build a strong credit history, and avoid exhausting your credit limit.

According to reports, about 1.01 billion debit cards were circulating in India as of September 2022. If anything, this shows what a popular payment mode debit cards are. Also called plastic money, debit cards eliminate the need for cash-based transactions. All one needs to do is swipe their credit card on a POS device or enter their card details to make a purchase online, and voila! The money gets debited instantly from the bank account. If you’re looking to get a debit card for this reason and have researched, you know you must choose one from the range of available card providers. The most popular ones being Visa and RuPay. Wondering what are the differences between the RuPay and Visa cards? Read on to find out. What is a RuPay debit card? All debit cards use a payment network to relay information about card transactions between the cardholder and the merchant. While there are many international payment networks, RuPay is a card network launched by the NPCI (National Payments Corporation of India), which has its own payment gateway. All the card transactions get processed domestically as well. This means lower transaction charges and faster transactions. Launched originally to initiate a less-cash economy, today, over 1,100 financial institutions (public, private, co-operative, and rural) have partnered with RuPay to offer you debit cards. And you can get one from a financial institution of your choice. Features of RuPay debit card. 1. Secured and user friendly. RuPay cards are equipped with pin-based security and EMV chips to facilitate secure transactions. Additionally, these cards offer the utmost convenience as they are accepted at all domestic ATMs and various online and offline merchants, making your payments hassle-free. 2. Lower transaction fees. RuPay cards perform transactions over a domestic payment network. This means lower transaction fees for merchants and lower prices for customers transacting using these cards. 3. Added perks. On your purchases, you can gather reward points that can be redeemed for enticing cashback offers and savings on subsequent purchases. This gives your trades more value. Financial institutions provide cashback on purchases made at particular retailers or in particular categories, such as petrol, groceries, or internet shopping. 4. Benefits for travellers. Several card companies offer travel benefits on debit cards, including discounts of flight tickets and hotel bookings. What is a Visa debit card? This card is issued by a financial institution connected to the Visa (Visa International Service Association) payment network. Like the RuPay debit card, Visa uses its proprietary transaction network to help merchants and cardholders perform transactions. Plus, it is recognised widely internationally and has a strong presence in India as well. Visa cards offer customers access to funds 24*7 and make transactions securely. But that’s not all. Here are some additional features of the Visa debit card you should know about. Features of Visa debit card. 1. Access to a widespread ATM network. With a Visa debit card, you never have to worry about being cash-strapped in India or abroad. With 1.9 million ATMs in 200 countries worldwide, you’re bound to find a Visa ATM to withdraw currency securely. 2. Transaction safety. Besides regular protection methods, Visa cards also offer a zero liability process through which you are always protected from unauthorised charges and constant monitoring to help you detect suspicious activity. 3. Top-notch customer assistance. If you lose your Visa debit card during your travels, you can request help from Visa’s Global Customer Assistance Service. Active 24*7, Visa’s customer service reps will assist you with card related issues instantly. 4. Visa benefits. Some Visa debit cards provide extra benefits, including travel insurance, extended warranty coverage for your purchases, protection in case of damage or theft, and even access to unique concierge services that can assist you with various needs. Now that you know the features of RuPay and Visa cards, the obvious question is this – ‘Which card is best Visa or RuPay?’ Read this next section to find out. RuPay vs Visa debit card. RuPay is an Indian domestic debit card network launched by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). It is accepted at all ATMs and merchants in India. RuPay cards are typically issued by banks in India and are linked to Indian bank accounts. Visa, on the other hand, is an international debit card network. It is accepted in over 200 countries and territories around the world. Visa cards are issued by banks all over the world and are linked to bank accounts in various countries. Visa or RuPay: Which is better? So, the debit card you choose depends on your specific needs and the transactions you make. If you primarily make transactions within India, then RuPay offers several advantages. It is designed to cater to the needs of typical Indian customers and is widely accepted within the country. On the flip side, if you frequently travel abroad or make international transactions, Visa cards are more suitable. Visa has a global presence and is accepted in numerous countries worldwide. This flexibility allows you to use your card conveniently outside India and transact internationally. Considering the difference between RuPay and Visa cards, you can choose the best one for you or even opt for having both if you can make the maximum of their usage. In summary. RuPay and Visa debit cards allow you to make cashless transactions and provide liquidity quickly whenever needed. Their differences lie in how the transactions are processed, their usage, and the benefits specific card companies offer. Looking for an alternative way to obtain quick liquidity without dipping into your savings? A personal loan can help you with such financing.
